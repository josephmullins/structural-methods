Some ideas for this assignment:

- extend previous week to case with time limits
- walk them through a clustering routine using the wage equation only ** can do an example instread of a homework **
- have them make an identification argument for their chosen moments from last week?
- have them estimate types using matrix diagonalization
- have them evaluate model fit and comment on what they are missing
- have them run a counterfactual with pre: welfare reform.
- could make them think about what happens when we add shocks to the wage equation? estimate how?
