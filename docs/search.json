    "text": "Topics\n\nIdentification, Credible Inference, and Marschak’s Maxim\n2024 is the last year I will make this topic a part of the course.\nWe formally define identification and discuss (via examples) what people really mean when they talk about identification and credible inference. We use the Generalized Roy Model to compare identification via functional form to nonparametric identification.\nWe introduce Marschak’s Maxim as a guide for doing empirical model-based research.\n\nReading\nThe two survey articles by Keane (2010) (link) and Angrist and Pischke (2010) (link) - although aging - provide two important perspectives on the issues of credible inference in economics. Low and Meghir (2017) provide a nice review of the advantages of the structural approach.\nThe original paper by Marschak (1953) may be of interest. Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) provide a nice discussion of Marschak’s Maxim in the context of policy evaluation. They introduce (Heckman and Vytlacil 2005; Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil 2011) the Marginal Treatment Effect as a tool for thinking about quasi-experimental estimators and policy evaluation.\n\n\n\nDynamic Discrete Choice\nWe introduce the dynamic discrete choice model and briefly discuss identification when all persistent state variables are observed. We review some of the basics of discrete choice such as the generalized extreme value distribution, which produces tractable choice probabilities with relatively flexible cross-price elasticities.\n\nReading\nThe main example that we work with throughout the course can be found in Mullins (2022) (pdf).\nRust (1987) is the canonical example demonstrating estimation of dynamic discrete choice models with maximum likelihood and a nested solution method.\nWe show that if one can directly estimate choice probabilities, several tractable approaches produce estimates of structural parameters without repeatedly solving the model. These include Hotz and Miller (1993), Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002), Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007), Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2008), and Arcidiacono and Miller (2011). We will review these methods and why they are not appropriate to use in Mullins (2022).\n\n\n\nEstimation of Dynamic Models with Unobserved Heterogeneity\nUsing Mullins (2022) as an example, we talk about the inferential pitfalls that can occur when models fail to account for unobserved heterogeneity. We briefly discuss how this can depend on estimation approaches and sources of identification.\nWe review methods for estimation of dynamic models, including the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM) (see, e.g. Arcidiacono and Miller (2011)) and the clustering approach of Bonhomme and Manresa (2015). We review practical considerations for these approaches and introduce the Forward-Back algorithm for implementing EM in hidden Markov Models with time-varying unobserved state variables. We introduce a sparse matrix implementation of this algorithm.\n\n\nIdentification of Dynamic Models with Unobserved Heterogeneity\nWe discuss how either panel data or instrumental variables can facilitate identification of models with unobserved heterogeneity, and briefly review identification results for finite mixtures in panel data settings due to Kasahara and Shimotsu (2009) and Bonhomme, Jochmans, and Robin (2016). Berry and Compiani (2023) analyze identification and estimation of dynamic models with persistent heterogeneity using instrumental variables."

    "text": "Since you only have a week, I’m not going to make you code every piece of the model solution. The folder /children-cash-transfers/src contains:\n\nfunctions to calculate utility and net income from each choice\nan indexing rule that maps choices to hours and participation\nthe structure for the nested logit and code to calculate nested logit probabilities and inclusive values\nfunctions to calculate transition probabilities\ncode to define a default set of parameters and hyperparameters (the number of wage shocks, number of types, etc)\n\nIf you have cloned the course git repo, you can load all of this source code as follows:\n\ninclude(\"../children-cash-transfers/src/model.jl\")\n\nplain_logit (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIt will help to quickly explain some of this, but I recommend you read the code carefully since I won’t explain the functions in depth.\n\n\nRecall that in the model there are only three state variables to track: (1) the individual’s type (\\(k\\)); (2) the wage shock (\\(\\varepsilon\\)); and (3) cumulative welfare use (\\(\\omega\\)). Below we define a struct called model_data that contains all of the exogenous state variables that are taken as given for each individual in the data. The struct is defined in /children-cash-transfers/src/model.jl, but we repeat the definition here:\n\nstruct model_data\n    T::Int64 #&lt;- length of problem\n\n    y0::Int64 #&lt;- year to begin problem\n    age0::Int64 # &lt;- mother's age at start of problem\n    SOI::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- state SOI in each year\n    num_kids::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- number of kids in household that are between age 0 and 17\n    TotKids::Int64 #&lt;- indicares the total number of children that the mother will have over the available panel\n    age_kid::Matrix{Int64} #&lt; age_kid[f,t] is the age of child f at time t. Will be negative if child not born yet.\n    cpi::Vector{Float64} #&lt;- cpi\n\n    R::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- indicates if work requirement in time t\n    Kω::Int64 #&lt;- indicates length of time limit once introduced\n    TL::Vector{Bool} #&lt;- indicating that time limit is in place\nend\n\nEventually we will have one of these objects for every mother we observe in the data, and we’ll solve the resulting dynamic program for each of them. To test our functions below we can create a test version of this struct as well as some default parameters:\n\nmd = test_model()\np = pars(2,6) #&lt;- set Kτ = 2 and Kε = 5\n\n\n\n\nThe function nested_logit takes the value of each choice vj and fills log-choice probabilities into a pre-allocated vector logP. It also returns the inclusive value (the “emax” or continuation value). The input \\(B=(B_1,B_2,...,B_L)\\) specifies the partitions in each layer of the tree, while the input \\(C\\) reports the final choices that are ultimately contained in each node in each layer. By definition, at the highest layer, the partition takes the trivial form \\(B_L=\\{\\{1,2,...K_L\\}\\}\\) where \\(K_L\\) is the number of partitions in layer \\(L-1\\). Similarly at the lowest layer, \\(C_{1}\\) must take the form \\(C_{1} = \\{\\{1\\},\\{2\\},...,\\{J\\}\\}\\). For this model with three participation choices that lead into an extensive marginal labor supply choice, the structure is:\n\nB₁ = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\nC₁ = [[1,],[2,],[3,],[4,],[5,],[6,]]\n\nB₂ = [[1,2,3]]\nC₂ = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\n\nB = (B₁,B₂)\nC = (C₁,C₂)\n\nThis is defined in src/model/choices.jl. This is for your understanding, but these inputs are all given to you so you can use the function naively if that is all your time allows for.\n\n\n\nYou may find the following objects useful for iterating over the state variables. Let \\(k_{\\tau}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\tau}\\}\\) index latent types, let \\(k_{\\varepsilon}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\varepsilon}\\}\\) index wage shocks, and let \\(k_{\\omega} = \\omega+1\\) index cumulative time use. The total size of the state space is \\(K=K_\\tau\\times K_{\\varepsilon} \\times K_{\\omega}\\).\nOne way to do simple indexing is to just work with multi-dimensional arrays and build this into every function. However if you want to add state variables later on it will make it cumbersome to change. Another option is to use LinearIndices objects and their converse, CartesianIndices.\nHere’s a demonstration:\n\n# Hypothetical state space dimensions:\nKε = 5\nKτ = 5\nKω = 6\n\nk_idx = LinearIndices((Kτ,Kε,Kω))\nk_inv = CartesianIndices(k_idx)\n\n# To get the aggregate index k, call:\nk = k_idx[2,3,2]\n@show k\n# Then if we have k we can work back with:\nk_tuple = Tuple(k_inv[k])\n@show k_tuple\n\nk = 37\nk_tuple = (2, 3, 2)\n\n\n(2, 3, 2)\n\n\nSo when iterating, you could think about passing around state indices along with instances of these linear and cartesian indices that allow you to convert back and forth.\n\n\n\nIn the paper, wage shocks are parameterized with a single parameter \\(\\pi_{W}\\) that dictates the probability that an individual remains in the same place on the grid space, with symmetric probabilities of moving up or down. The function fε in states_transitions.jl takes the current wage shock kε and the total number of shocks Kε, along with πW and returns two tuples. The first tuple is the set of grid points that are possible and the second is the probability of being in each of those points.\nFor example:\n\nfε(3,5,0.9)\n\n((2, 3, 4), (0.04999999999999999, 0.9, 0.04999999999999999))\n\n\nSo the function is telling me that when I’m in state 3 I can move to states 3, 4, or 5 next period with probabilities (0.05,0.9,0.05). When we are at the bottom or the top of the grid space, the probabilities are slightly different:\n\nfε(1,5,0.9)\n\n((1, 2), (0.04999999999999999, 0.95))\n\n\nWe could have alternatively just written the transition probabilities into a matrix, but this approach essentially limits us to points with positive probabilities and will simplify iteration.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function calc_vj that calculates the choice-specific value (i.e. the deterministic value of the choice) of a particular choice \\(j\\) in a particular time period \\(t\\) given the state and other exogenous variables. If you are confident you can code this however you like, but given the existing setup you might like to write the function in a way that it takes the following inputs:\n\nj: the discrete choice\nt: the time period in the model\nstate: a tuple that contains the state \\((k_\\tau,k_\\varepsilon,k_\\omega)\\) as well as a linear indexing rule\nV: a vector that contains the continuation value for each state at time \\(t+1\\)\npars: the parameters of the model\nmd: an instance of the model_data object that holds all relevant state variables\n\nVerify that your function works by testing it on the model_data instance created by test_model. Use the @time macro to look at evaluation time and memory allocations.\n\n\n\nWrite a function called iterate! that iterates over all states at time period \\(t\\) and fills in choice probabilities and continuation values for period \\(t\\) in pre-allocated arrays. Again, you can do this however you like but here is a suggested set of inputs:\n\nt: the time period\nlogP: a \\(J \\times K \\times T\\) array of choice probabilities where the function will fill in logP[:,:,t]\nV: a \\(K \\times T\\) array of continuation values\nstate_idx: a named tuple that contains the size of the overall state space, a linear indexing rule that maps \\((k_\\tau,k_{\\varepsilon},k_{\\omega}\\)) to an overall state \\(k\\), and a Cartesian Indexing rule that inverts this mapping\nvj: a \\(J\\)-dimensional vector that, for each state, can be used as a container for the choice-specific values\npars: model parameters\nmd: model_data for the problem\n\nVerify that your function works by testing it on the model_data instance created by test_model.

    "text": "Since you only have a week, I’m not going to make you code every piece of the model solution. The folder /children-cash-transfers/src contains:\n\nfunctions to calculate utility and net income from each choice\nan indexing rule that maps choices to hours and participation\nthe structure for the nested logit and code to calculate nested logit probabilities and inclusive values\nfunctions to calculate transition probabilities\ncode to define a default set of parameters and hyperparameters (the number of wage shocks, number of types, etc)\n\nIf you have cloned the course git repo, you can load all of this source code as follows:\n\ninclude(\"../children-cash-transfers/src/model.jl\")\n\nplain_logit (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIt will help to quickly explain some of this, but I recommend you read the code carefully since I won’t explain the functions in depth.\n\n\nRecall that in the model there are only three state variables to track: (1) the individual’s type (\\(k\\)); (2) the wage shock (\\(\\varepsilon\\)); and (3) cumulative welfare use (\\(\\omega\\)). Below we define a struct called model_data that contains all of the exogenous state variables that are taken as given for each individual in the data. The struct is defined in /children-cash-transfers/src/model.jl, but we repeat the definition here:\n\nstruct model_data\n    T::Int64 #&lt;- length of problem\n\n    y0::Int64 #&lt;- year to begin problem\n    age0::Int64 # &lt;- mother's age at start of problem\n    SOI::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- state SOI in each year\n    num_kids::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- number of kids in household that are between age 0 and 17\n    TotKids::Int64 #&lt;- indicares the total number of children that the mother will have over the available panel\n    age_kid::Matrix{Int64} #&lt; age_kid[f,t] is the age of child f at time t. Will be negative if child not born yet.\n    cpi::Vector{Float64} #&lt;- cpi\n\n    R::Vector{Int64} #&lt;- indicates if work requirement in time t\n    Kω::Int64 #&lt;- indicates length of time limit once introduced\n    TL::Vector{Bool} #&lt;- indicating that time limit is in place\nend\n\nEventually we will have one of these objects for every mother we observe in the data, and we’ll solve the resulting dynamic program for each of them. To test our functions below we can create a test version of this struct as well as some default parameters:\n\nmd = test_model()\np = pars(2,6) #&lt;- set Kτ = 2 and Kε = 5\n\n\n\n\nThe function nested_logit takes the value of each choice vj and fills log-choice probabilities into a pre-allocated vector logP. It also returns the inclusive value (the “emax” or continuation value). The input \\(B=(B_1,B_2,...,B_L)\\) specifies the partitions in each layer of the tree, while the input \\(C\\) reports the final choices that are ultimately contained in each node in each layer. By definition, at the highest layer, the partition takes the trivial form \\(B_L=\\{\\{1,2,...K_L\\}\\}\\) where \\(K_L\\) is the number of partitions in layer \\(L-1\\). Similarly at the lowest layer, \\(C_{1}\\) must take the form \\(C_{1} = \\{\\{1\\},\\{2\\},...,\\{J\\}\\}\\). For this model with three participation choices that lead into an extensive marginal labor supply choice, the structure is:\n\nB₁ = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\nC₁ = [[1,],[2,],[3,],[4,],[5,],[6,]]\n\nB₂ = [[1,2,3]]\nC₂ = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\n\nB = (B₁,B₂)\nC = (C₁,C₂)\n\nThis is defined in src/model/choices.jl. This is for your understanding, but these inputs are all given to you so you can use the function naively if that is all your time allows for.\n\n\n\nYou may find the following objects useful for iterating over the state variables. Let \\(k_{\\tau}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\tau}\\}\\) index latent types, let \\(k_{\\varepsilon}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\varepsilon}\\}\\) index wage shocks, and let \\(k_{\\omega} = \\omega+1\\) index cumulative time use. The total size of the state space is \\(K=K_\\tau\\times K_{\\varepsilon} \\times K_{\\omega}\\).\nOne way to do simple indexing is to just work with multi-dimensional arrays and build this into every function. However if you want to add state variables later on it will make it cumbersome to change. Another option is to use LinearIndices objects and their converse, CartesianIndices.\nHere’s a demonstration:\n\n# Hypothetical state space dimensions:\nKε = 5\nKτ = 5\nKω = 6\n\nk_idx = LinearIndices((Kτ,Kε,Kω))\nk_inv = CartesianIndices(k_idx)\n\n# To get the aggregate index k, call:\nk = k_idx[2,3,2]\n@show k\n# Then if we have k we can work back with:\nk_tuple = Tuple(k_inv[k])\n@show k_tuple\n\nk = 37\nk_tuple = (2, 3, 2)\n\n\n(2, 3, 2)\n\n\nSo when iterating, you could think about passing around state indices along with instances of these linear and cartesian indices that allow you to convert back and forth.\n\n\n\nIn the paper, wage shocks are parameterized with a single parameter \\(\\pi_{W}\\) that dictates the probability that an individual remains in the same place on the grid space, with symmetric probabilities of moving up or down. The function fε in states_transitions.jl takes the current wage shock kε and the total number of shocks Kε, along with πW and returns two tuples. The first tuple is the set of grid points that are possible and the second is the probability of being in each of those points.\nFor example:\n\nfε(3,5,0.9)\n\n((2, 3, 4), (0.04999999999999999, 0.9, 0.04999999999999999))\n\n\nSo the function is telling me that when I’m in state 3 I can move to states 3, 4, or 5 next period with probabilities (0.05,0.9,0.05). When we are at the bottom or the top of the grid space, the probabilities are slightly different:\n\nfε(1,5,0.9)\n\n((1, 2), (0.04999999999999999, 0.95))\n\n\nWe could have alternatively just written the transition probabilities into a matrix, but this approach essentially limits us to points with positive probabilities and will simplify iteration."
