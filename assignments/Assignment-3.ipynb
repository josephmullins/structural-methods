    "Recall that in the model there are only three state variables to track: (1) the individual's type ($k$); (2) the wage shock ($\\varepsilon$); and (3) cumulative welfare use ($\\omega$). Below we define a struct called `model_data` that contains all of the exogenous state variables that are taken as given for each individual in the data. The struct is defined in `/children-cash-transfers/src/model.jl`, but we repeat the definition here:\n",
    "\n",

    "    SOI::Vector{Int64} #<- state SOI in each year\n",
    "    num_kids::Vector{Int64} #<- number of kids in household that are between age 0 and 17\n",
    "    TotKids::Int64 #<- indicares the total number of children that the mother will have over the available panel\n",
    "    age_kid::Matrix{Int64} #< age_kid[f,t] is the age of child f at time t. Will be negative if child not born yet.\n",

    "### Nested Logit Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `nested_logit` takes the value of each choice `vj` and fills log-choice probabilities into a pre-allocated vector `logP`. It also returns the inclusive value (the \"emax\" or continuation value). The input $B=(B_1,B_2,...,B_L)$ specifies the partitions in each layer of the tree, while the input $C$ reports the final choices that are ultimately contained in each node in each layer. By definition, at the highest layer, the partition takes the trivial form $B_L=\\{\\{1,2,...K_L\\}\\}$ where $K_L$ is the number of partitions in layer $L-1$. Similarly at the lowest layer, $C_{1}$ must take the form $C_{1} = \\{\\{1\\},\\{2\\},...,\\{J\\}\\}$. For this model with three participation choices that lead into an extensive marginal labor supply choice, the structure is:\n",

    "```julia .noeval\n",
    "B₁ = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\n",

    "\n",
    "B = (B₁,B₂)\n",
    "C = (C₁,C₂)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is defined in `src/model/choices.jl`. This is for your understanding, but these inputs are all given to you so you can use the function naively if that is all your time allows for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing the State\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the following objects useful for iterating over the state variables. Let $k_{\\tau}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\tau}\\}$ index latent types, let $k_{\\varepsilon}\\in\\{1,...,K_{\\varepsilon}\\}$ index wage shocks, and let $k_{\\omega} = \\omega+1$ index cumulative time use. The total size of the state space is $K=K_\\tau\\times K_{\\varepsilon} \\times K_{\\omega}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do simple indexing is to just work with multi-dimensional arrays and build this into every function. However if you want to add state variables later on it will make it cumbersome to change. Another option is to use `LinearIndices` objects and their converse, `CartesianIndices`.\n",

The function `fε` in `states_transitions.jl` takes the current wage shock `kε` and the total number of shocks `Kε`, along with  `πW` and returns two tuples. The first tuple is the set of grid points that are possible and the second is the probability of being in each of those points.\n",
