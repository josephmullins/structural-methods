# Estimating a Finite Mixture Model with EM

## Part 1

Take the model from [Assignment 3](Assignment-3.qmd) and introduce some **time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity** by allowing the cost parameter $\kappa$ to depend on an individuals type $k\in\{1,2,...,K\}$.

Write code to simulate data from a model with $K=2$. You can choose your own parameters for $(\kappa_{1},\kappa_{2})$. You can assume mixing probabilities $P[k=1]=P[k=2]=0.5$.

To simplify estimating initial conditions, you can assume that everyone in the data begins with $j_{0}=0$.

## Part 2

Now consider the problem of estimating the following set of probabilities:

$$ \mathbf{P} = \{P[k], P[j=1|j_{t-1}=0,k,w], P[j=1|j_{t-1}=0,k,w] \}_{k\in\{1,2\},\ w\in\{L,H\}} $$

Write code to estimate these probabilities using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. You can, as before, assume that $\pi$ and ($w_{L},w_{H})$ are known. 

You may find the following formulae helpful. Given a guess of $\mathbf{P}^{m}$, let $q_{nk}$ be the posterior probability that person $n$ is of type $k$. It can be written as:

$$ q_{nk} = \frac{P^{m}[k]\prod_{t=1}^{T}P^{m}[j=1|d_{n,t-1},k,w_{t}]^{d_{n,t}}(1 - P^{m}[j=1|d_{n,t-1},k,w_{t})^{1 - d_{n,t}}}{\sum_{k'}P^{m}[k']\prod_{t=1}^{T}P^{m}[j=1|d_{n,t-1},k',w_{t}]^{d_{n,t}}(1 - P^{m}[j=1|d_{n,t-1},k',w_{t})^{1 - d_{n,t}}} $$

where $d_{n,t}=1$ if person $n$ works in period $t$.

With these posteriors in hand, the m-step can be calculated using weighted frequency estimators. For example:

$$ P^{m+1}[j=1|j_{-1}=1,k,w_{H}] = \frac{\sum_{n,t}d_{n,t-1}d_{n,t}\mathbf{1}\{w_{t}=w_{H}\}q_{nk}}{\sum_{n,t}d_{n,t-1}\mathbf{1}\{w_{t}=w_{H}\}q_{nk}}.$$


## Part 3

Demonstrate the performance of your estimation algorithm by running a monte-carlo simulation.
