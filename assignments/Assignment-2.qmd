Use the same labor supply model as Assignment 1. Now we assume that .

1. Does $Z$ necessarily satisfy the monotonicity condition? In other words, can the direction of the labor supply response differ for different joint values of $A_{n},\alpha_{n}
2. What does this tell you about the estimated parameters?
3. Linearize the model?
4. Can we estimate by GMM? Implement!
